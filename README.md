CAREER GUIDANCE CHATBOT
 Utilizing Streamlit, NLP, and Python, I developed a career guidance chatbot. Users upload job roles, and the chatbot retrieves relevant skills from a dataset. It provides concise job descriptions along with required skills in real-time interaction. The system gathers feedback for continuous improvement and integrates with job boards for comprehensive career guidance.
